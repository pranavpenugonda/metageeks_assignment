Coding Best Practices:
----------------------------
1. Consistent and Readable Code:
----------------------------------
-> Use descriptive names for variables, functions, classes, and methods. 
to enhance code readability.
-> Consistently format the code following a chosen style guide. 
Proper indentation, spacing, and consistent formatting improve code 
readability and maintainability.
-> Use comments effectively to explain complex logic 
where necessary. Additionally, maintain documentation to describe the 
purpose of modules, functions, and APIs for easy understanding by other 
developers.

2.Modular and Don't Repeat Yourself Code:
--------------------------------------------
-> Divide code into smaller, reusable modules or functions. Each module 
should have a single responsibility.
-> Avoid duplication of code by creating reusable components. If the 
same code is used in multiple places, refactor it into a function or 
module to promote maintainability and reduce the risk of errors.

3.Testing and Error Handling:
-------------------------------------
-> Implement automated unit tests to validate the behavior of individual 
components.
-> Handle errors gracefully by implementing try-catch blocks, assertions, 
and appropriate error  messages to handle exceptional conditions and 
prevent application crashes.
