Use Cases for SQL Databases:

Transactions: Applications requiring complex transactions and strict consistency.
Financial Systems: Banking, accounting, e-commerce where data integrity and consistency are critical.
Relational Data: Applications that have structured and predefined relationships between entities.


Use Cases for NoSQL Databases:

Scalability and Performance: Applications requiring high throughput and scalability, especially in distributed environments.
Big Data and Real-time Analytics: Handling large volumes of data, IoT (Internet of Things), and real-time analytics.
Content Management Systems: Storing varied types of content (documents, images, videos) without a fixed schema.
